I really enjoyed it. It's powerful, creative and it continuously provides new unpredictable layers that fit incredibly well the tune of the songs. It sounds both unstable and catchy at the same time. It's hard for me to get these songs out of my head. 
The second part of the album sounds a bit unpolished, but it's still quite good. 

> I'm not that familiar with the story of this record but it sounds like an interesting one.
