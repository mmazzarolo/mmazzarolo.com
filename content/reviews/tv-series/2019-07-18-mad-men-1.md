The first season of Mad Men offers a little taste of what the entire serie will be: a slice of life about the 1960s American workplace and a beautiful introspection of characters that feel incredibly "real".  
If you're not prepared to this kind of show the first season might be brutal because you'll be thrown into it and you'll probably wait for *something* to happen. You'll want it. But it won't happen.
