A slice of life about the 1960s American workplace and a beautiful introspection of characters that feel incredibly "real".  
I haven't any other show that glued me to the screen just for the character development alone. Mad Men doesn't need action or clich√® to tell you an interesting story: I find remarkable that the entire plot of Mad Men seems to only be a brilliant excuse to let you learn more about the characters, their story and their growth.
