I liked it.  
This second season shows a bunch of improvements over the first one: it's deeper, it builds the suspence better, it's more introspective and it just seems more _real_ (the "The Wire" vibes were quite strong in a couple of occasions).  
I feel like Mindhunter is starting to be one of the strongest (if not **the** strongest) Netflix TV serie.
