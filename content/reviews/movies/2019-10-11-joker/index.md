Let me start of by saying that Joaquin Phoenix performance was really good.  
Cool. Now, about the movie... I didn't like it, that's not my kind of show.  
To me, Joker is just a movie about Joaquin Phoenix playing Joker. That's it.  
This movie felt completely empty. No message, no character development.  
The way the director tried to fill the void is by playing a bit with serious topics: mental health, social class inequality, protest. In Joker there's a little bit of everything but I have the impression that it's all used only for the sake of making the movie look deep, mature and edgy.  
It's just kind of dull.
