Just like many other already said: _"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" is Quentin Tarantino's love letter to Hollywood_.  
I would have never expected to see Tarantino make this kind of movie, but I'm grateful he did:  
I liked its black-comedy(sh) slow pacing;  
I liked how the homages to Hollywood fit and the late 60s nostalgia;  
I like the acting, with a Di Caprio stellar performance that steals the show, making a great Brad Pitt performance look almost ordinary;  
I liked how Tarantino's excessive style wasn't **that** excessive this time.  
I'm a bit sad that somehow it didn't wrap up every plot in the movie... but it's ok.  
So, yeah, this movie was pretty good.
