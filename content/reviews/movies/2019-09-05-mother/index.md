I'll be honest: I spent the first hour of Mother! trying to understand what was going on. It was clear to me that it wasn't being weird just for the sake of it, but I couldn't grasp what the real theme of the movie was.  
I started to understand what was happening and what being referenced only in the second half of the movie, which was when I started to appreciate it... even if it still wasn't completely clear to me.  
After getting a partial confirmation online about what its theme is and after giving it some thought, everything finally started to click and the story got straightforward without being exagerately pretensious.  
I liked it.
