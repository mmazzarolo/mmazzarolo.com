It could have been better.  
The storyline seemed quite boring to me and I feel that the script was predictable: it's impossible to not guess the most important twist even an hour before it's officially revealed.  
The over the top action ending also didn't fit much the purpose of the move in my opinion.  
Acting was ok.
