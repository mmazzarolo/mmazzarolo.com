I'm starting to think that Lanthimos' movies are my Achilles' heel.  
I liked the performances, I enjoyed the shot constructions and camera work, I'm totally fine with the movie theme and plot... but I still can't get past my limitation of not being able to appreciate the movie being presented in a(irritatingly, for me) smug tone.
