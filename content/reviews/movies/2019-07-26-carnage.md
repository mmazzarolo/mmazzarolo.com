Oh well, I'm a sucker for movies entirely focused on a handful of character. I enjoyed Carnage, it has a fun Woody Allen vibe and I liked the acting. That said, I didn't find it particularly insightful and I feel like the characters should have been a bit more "balanced": I'm quite sure everyone will tend to simpatize way more with the most rational character (Waltz's one) than with the others.
