I appreciate the "tentative" of exploring the mobster world's "psychology" over its "action" side, but the result doesn't hit the right spot on this movie to get enough depth: monodimensional characters, a dull soundtrack, a bunch of stereotypes and a too strong inspiration from Scorsese.  
Good Pacino performance though.
