I love [fast software](https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/).  
I hate slow animations that don't provide any value.

<br />

Here's a short video of me clicking on a ticket in the new and shiny [Jira Cloud for Mac](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/mac):

<video autoplay controls loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="/videos/jira-app.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="/videos/jira-app.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>

And here's another short video of me clicking on the same ticket on Jira Cloud in the browser:

<video autoplay controls loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="/videos/jira-web.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="/videos/jira-web.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>

Which one feels faster?

I still can't believe I'm praising the speed of the Jira web interface.
