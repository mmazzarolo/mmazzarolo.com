After a few weekends of work, today I finally published [Ordinary Puzzles](https://ordinarypuzzles.com) in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ordinary-puzzles/id1489599807) and in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmazzarolo.ordinarypuzzles).  
You can find the source-code of the app on [GitHub](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/ordinary-puzzles-app).

Ordinary Puzzles is a puzzle game inspired by [Juho Snellman](https://www.snellman.net/)'s [Linjat](https://linjat.snellman.net/#fp).  
I discovered Linjat a while ago on Hacker News. I liked the concept of its Picross-like puzzles, so after a quick chat with Juho I decided to port it to a mobile game.

The font used across the entire app is [Averta](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intelligent-foundry/averta/), by [Kostas Bartsokas](http://www.kostasbartsokas.com/).  
For licensing reason the Averta font files are not included in the source code.

Ordinary Puzzles is built with [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html).
