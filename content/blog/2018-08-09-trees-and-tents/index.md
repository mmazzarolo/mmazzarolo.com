React-Native implementation of the Trees and Tents puzzle game I built in my free time.

The rules are simple:

- Place tents in the grid.
- Each tree should have one tent next to it (horizontally or vertically).
- Tents do not touch each other, not even diagonally.
- The numbers outside the grid show how many tents there are in that row or column.
