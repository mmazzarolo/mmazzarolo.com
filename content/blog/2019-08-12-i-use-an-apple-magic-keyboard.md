I am a firm believer of the multiple benefits of keeping the arrow keys to the home row of your keyboard. If you're not familiar with this concept, it basically says that, since the natural hand position on a keyboard is on the home row (the one with the F/J buttons), mapping keys of the home row to the arrow keys is an ergonomic way to type faster.

For years I've been using CAPS-LOCK as my activation key, which is a popular choice, but it has major flaw imho: it requires you to use two different hands to input the arrow keys.  
Using two hands is perfectly fine if you're just pressing the arrow keys, but it becomes incredibly confusing when you start combining them with Option, CMD and Shift for more complex actions.

That's why I started looking for alternative solutions.  
For example I tried setting the activation key as a "switch", so that you can toggle between the standard typing mode and the arrow movement mode (a la' vim)... but this solution ended up slowing me down too much for simple use cases, because it involves 3 inputs even if I needed a single arrow key (toggle on -> arrow key -> toggle off).

Then I finally decided moving the activation key to the right side of the keyboard, to the RIGHT CMD key, so that I can control it with just my right hand... and it took just a few hours of practice to make it "click". Even complex selections started to become manageble with this approach, and after a while I completely stopped actively thinking about which key combination I needed to do.

Unofortunately after some time I noticed that this approach wasn't all sunshine and rainbows: the finger movement needed to position my right thumb on the right CMD key was not easy and after long typing sessions I could definitely feel that I was putting some strain on it.
I have small hands, so reaching the right CMD key was definitely not a natural movement for me... at least on standard keyboards.
During that time I was using a [Varmilo VA87](https://www.varmilo.com/keyboardproscenium/en_subject_product_detailed?subjectid=31) keyboard as my daily driver. I love the tactile feeling of a good mechanical keyboard, but since sometimes I was still typing on the go on my MacBook I noticed something I wasn't aware of.

Typing on the crappy MacBook keyboard had a huge advantage for nm over the other keyboards: it has a really short space bar that leaves more space for the right and left CMD keys, making them way more easily reachable than on a standard keyboard.

Once I realized that, I moved from my mechanical keyboard to the Apple Magic keyboard, which is still the keyboard I'm currently using.
It took me a bit to get comfortable with its keyboard travel and feeling (which is miles behind my previous keyboard) but I'm ok with it now, and I can finally use the arrow keys (and a few other custom keys I added to the home row) like I always wanted.
This setup also has the added benefit of completely removing the adjustment that would have been needed while jumping between the MacBook keyboard and the external one: they have the same layout and a pretty similar keys distance.

Let me clarify one thing: by "standard" keyboard I mean non-Apple keyboards.
Even Apple-focused keyboards like the [Matias Tactile](https://matias.ca/tactilepro/) dont't use the real Apple keyboard layout and have a long spacebar.
