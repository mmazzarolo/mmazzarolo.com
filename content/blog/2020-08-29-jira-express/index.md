I recently published [Jira Express](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/jira-express), a Chrome and Firefox extension that gives you a quick access to your recent Jira tickets and to a simplified Jira search.

Jira Express is built with Create React App, TypeScript, and Styled-Components.

Give it a try by downloading it from the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lpkkljaepfhmbjaepaoeoadlmfoipnoc) or from the [Firefox developer hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jira-express/).

**Jira Express is not a substitute of the full blown Jira interface.**

My goal with this project was just creating something that would allow me to avoid opening the Jira web interface as much as possible by speeding up the ticket search process.

Check its [GitHub](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/jira-express) page for the source-code and for more details.

Contribution are welcome!
