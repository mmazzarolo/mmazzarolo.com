I recently published [Remotebear](https://remotebear.io/), a remote jobs aggregator that keeps you up to date with the latest opportunities from the greatest remote tech companies.

Compared to other remote jobs aggregator, Remotebear focus is:

- Collecting all the remote job opportunities of tech-companies **without any hand-picking**.
- Allowing you to **filter jobs based on your location** (for non-US engineers, having to deal with the amount of US-only remote jobs can be extremely frustrating).
- Being **free**, and respectful of your privacy.
