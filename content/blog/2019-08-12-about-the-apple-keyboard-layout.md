I am a firm believer that keeping the cursor keys to the home row of your keyboard provides multiple benefits.
If you're not familiar with this concept, it basically says that, since to reach the cursor keys of your keyboard you need to move your palm, mapping the cursor keys to a set of keys in the center of your keyboard is an ergonomic solution to make you type faster.  
Vim user should be familiar with this approach, since Vim defaults the cursos keys to <kbd>H</kbd>, <kbd>J</kbd>, <kbd>K</kbd> and <kbd>L</kbd>.

For the last few years, I've been remapping my keboard <kbd>I</kbd>, <kbd>J</kbd>, <kbd>K</kbd> and <kbd>L</kbd> keys to the cursor key, enabled by pressing them while keeping <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> down. This seems to be quite [a popular choice](https://tonsky.me/blog/cursor-keys/) but I think it has a major flaw: it requires you to use two different hands to use the cursor keys.  
Using two hands is perfectly fine if you're just pressing the arrow keys, but it becomes incredibly confusing when you start combining them with <kbd>Option</kbd>, <kbd>Command</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> for more complex actions.

That's why I started looking for alternative solutions.  
For example I tried setting the <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> key as a "switch", so that I could toggle between the standard typing mode and the arrow movement mode (à la Vim). Unfortunately this solution ended up slowing me down too much for simple use cases, because it involves multiple key presses (toggle on → cursor key → toggle off) even for a single input.

Then, I finally decided to move the activation key from <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> to the <kbd>Right Command</kbd> key, which is the approach I'm still currently using.
Since the activation key is now on the right side of the keyboard I can control it with ease with just my right hand. It took me just a few hours of practice to make it "click": now even complex selections are manageable and I'm not actively thinking about which key combination I need to input anymore.

Unofortunately after some time I noticed that this approach wasn't all sunshine and rainbows: the finger movement needed to position my right thumb on the right <kbd>Command</kbd> key was not easy and after long typing sessions I could definitely feel that I was putting some strain on it.
I have small hands, so reaching the right <kbd>Command</kbd> key was definitely not a natural movement for me... at least on standard keyboards.
During that time I was using a [Varmilo VA87](https://www.varmilo.com/keyboardproscenium/en_subject_product_detailed?subjectid=31) keyboard as my daily driver. I love the tactile feeling of a good mechanical keyboard, but since sometimes I was still typing on the go on my MacBook I noticed something I wasn't aware of.

Typing on the crappy MacBook keyboard had a huge advantage for nm over the other keyboards: it has a really short space bar that leaves more space for the right and left <kbd>Command</kbd> keys, making them way more easily reachable than on a standard keyboard.

Once I realized that, I moved from my mechanical keyboard to the Apple Magic keyboard, which is still the one I'm currently using.

It took me a bit to get comfortable with its keyboard travel and typing feeling (which is miles behind my previous keyboard) but I'm ok with it now, and I can finally use the arrow keys (and a few other custom keys I added to the home row) like I always wanted.
This setup also has the added benefit of completely removing the adjustment that would have been needed while jumping between the MacBook keyboard and the external one: they have the same layout and a pretty similar keys distance.

I spent quite some time looking for good mechanical keyboards with the Apple layout, but even Apple-focused keyboards like the [Matias Tactile](https://matias.ca/tactilepro/) dont't use it and have a long spacebar (I guess the only way to get one for now is building it from scratch).
