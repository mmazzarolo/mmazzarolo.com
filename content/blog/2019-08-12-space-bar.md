I am a firm believer that keeping the cursor keys to the center of your keyboard provides multiple benefits: since to reach the cursor keys of your keyboard you need to move your palm, mapping the cursor keys to a set of keys in the center of your keyboard is an ergonomic solution to make you type faster.  
Vim users should be familiar with this approach, since Vim defaults the cursor keys to <kbd>H</kbd>, <kbd>J</kbd>, <kbd>K</kbd> and <kbd>L</kbd>.

For the last few years I've been using software like [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) on Windows and [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) on macOS to remap my keyboards so that pressing <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>, <kbd>J</kbd>, <kbd>K</kbd> or <kbd>L</kbd> acts as cursor keys. This seems to be quite [a popular choice](https://tonsky.me/blog/cursor-keys/) but I think it has a major flaw: it requires you to use two different hands to use the cursor keys.  
Using two hands is perfectly fine if you need a simple cursor input (e.g.: moving between the options of a dropdown), but for my tastes it is often confusing when you start combining them with <kbd>Option</kbd>, <kbd>Command</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> for more complex actions... especially if you're used to press <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> with your pinky (you should, especially if you touch-type).

That's why I started looking for alternative solutions.  
For example I tried setting the <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> key as a "switch", so that I could toggle between the standard typing mode and the arrow movement mode (à la Vim). Unfortunately this solution ended up slowing me down too much for simple use cases, because it involves multiple key presses (toggle on → cursor key → toggle off) even for a single input.

Then, I finally decided to move the activation key from <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> to the <kbd>Right Command</kbd> key, which is the approach I'm still currently using.
Since the activation key is now on the right side of the keyboard I can control it with ease with just my right hand. It took me just a few hours of practice to make it "click": now even complex selections are manageable and I'm not actively thinking about which key combination I need to press anymore.

## Macbook keyboard layout

Unfortunately after some time I noticed that this approach wasn't all sunshine and rainbows: the finger movement needed to position my right thumb on the right <kbd>Command</kbd> key was not easy to do and after long typing sessions I could definitely feel that I was putting some strain on it.
I have small hands, so reaching the right <kbd>Command</kbd> key was definitely not a natural movement for me...

...at least on standard keyboards layouts.
During that time I was using a [Varmilo VA87](https://www.varmilo.com/keyboardproscenium/en_subject_product_detailed?subjectid=31) keyboard (a fantastic mechanical one) as my daily driver but sometimes I was still typing on the go on my Macbook internal keyboard.  
Ironically enough, even with its horrible key travel I noticed that typing on the Macbook internal keyboard was more comfortable than typing on the Varmilo one, especially for my right and left thumbs.  
Initially I thought it was just an impression, that maybe the flat keys of the Macbook were more suited for my short fingers.
I think it actually took more time than it should have for me to understand what was putting less strain on my hands: it was the Macbook keyboard layout.
You see, the Macbook (or better, the Apple) keyboard layout has a shorter space bar than the more common keyboard layouts, leaving more space for the right and left <kbd>Command</kbd> keys.

This small difference alone has a huge impact on my typing sessions. I use both the right and left <kbd>Command</kbd> keys a ton, so being able to press them easily is great plus. All thanks to a smaller spacebar.

## Why is the spacebar so big?

Well, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_bar) it seems to be mostly for historical reasons, because they were mechanically different than the rest of the keys and needed more force:

> Originally (on early writers dating back to the late 19th century) the "bar" was literally a metal bar running across the full width of the keyboard (or even wider, and even surrounding it) that triggered the carriage advance without also firing any of the typebars towards the platen. Later examples gradually shrank and developed into their current more ergonomic form as a wide, centrally located but otherwise apparently normal "key", as typewriter (and computer) keyboards began to incorporate additional function keys and were more deliberately "styled". Although it varies by keyboard type, the space bar usually lies between the Alt keys (or Command keys on Macintosh keyboards) and below the letter keys: C, V, B, N and M on a standard QWERTY keyboard.

Some countries seem to use a smaller spacebar.
For example in Japan the space character is not used much, so the standard Japanese layout has a spacebar even smaller then the Macbook one:

Once I realized that I started looking for keyboards with small spacebars, mostly out of curiosity.

moved from my mechanical keyboard to the Apple Magic keyboard, which is still the one I'm currently using.

It took me a bit to get comfortable with its keyboard travel and typing feeling (which is miles behind my previous keyboard) but I'm ok with it now, and I can finally use the arrow keys (and a few other custom keys I added to the home row) like I always wanted.
This setup also has the added benefit of completely removing the adjustment that would have been needed while jumping between the MacBook keyboard and the external one: they have the same layout and a pretty similar keys distance.

I spent quite some time looking for good mechanical keyboards with the Apple layout, but even Apple-focused keyboards like the [Matias Tactile](https://matias.ca/tactilepro/) dont't use it and have a long spacebar (I guess the only way to get one for now is building it from scratch).

Unfortunately after some time I noticed that this approach wasn't _that perfect_: the finger movement needed to position my right thumb on the right <kbd>Command</kbd> key was not easy to do and after long typing sessions I could definitely feel that I was putting some strain on it.

I did some investigation on what other keyboards have a small space bar (more on it in a next post) but at the end of the day I the most practical solution seems to be using a [compact Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english)¹. The alternative solutions required using a totally different layout from the Macbook keyboard (that I'm still going to use often) or building the keyboard myself (but I'm not willing to go _that deep_ just for a smaller space bar).  
Yes, I agree, it doesn't have the same typing feeling of a mechanical keyboard but at least for now I'm typing comfortably.
