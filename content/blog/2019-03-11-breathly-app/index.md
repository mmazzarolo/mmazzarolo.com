Today I published [Breathly App](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/breathly-app): a React-Native mobile app that allows you to focus on your breathing.  
You can use Breathly for daily relaxation and breath training: just choose a breathing technique and focus on the guided exercise.

Breathly is a small React-Native app that I developed on my free time in 2018 for playing around with the React-Native Animated API.
With the incoming React-Native's hooks support (in 0.59) I decided to get back on it, rewrite it with hooks, and also release it in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmazzarolo.breathly) and in [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/breathly/id1454852966).

A landing page for the app is available at [breathly.app](https://breathly.app).

You can find the source code of the app, an architecture overview and a few details on how it was build on the [GitHub](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/breathly-app) repo.
