    ðŸ‘‹ Here I'm logging my opinions and feelings about movies, tv-series, albums and books, with a score from 1 to 5 to indicate how much I enjoyed them.<br/>  
    P.S.: My older <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~mazzaaaaa#musicrating">albums</a> and <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~mazzaaaaa#filmrating">movies</a> ratings are still on RateYourMusic.
