A slice of life of a 1960s American workplace. A beautiful introspection of characters that feel incredibly real. No over-the-top action. No clich√®.     
I find remarkable that the entire plot of Mad Men seems to be just a brilliant excuse to let you learn more about the characters, their story and their development... and that this trick works (almost) flawlessly for 7 seasons.
