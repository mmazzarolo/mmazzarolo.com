I really enjoyed it. It's powerful, creative and it continuously provides new unpredictable layers that fit incredibly well the tune of the songs. It sounds both catchy and experimental at the same time... It's hard for me to get these songs out of my head.  
A minor issue is that it sounds a bit unpolished, but hey, that's what you get when you leak an album.
